Translation
===========

This repo provides demos on how to use translation API from Microsoft,
Baidu and Google with Python3.

## Microsoft Translation API ##

[This page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd576287.aspx)
provides how to use this API.  You need to register an Anzure account
and apply for an api key.  This service is totally free, but with some
quota limit.  But it's enough for average use.

## Baidu Translation API ##

[This page](http://developer.baidu.com/wiki/index.php?title=帮助文档首
页/百度翻译API) (in Chinese) provides how to use this API.  You also
need to register an api key.  As the Microsoft API, This service is
also free, with quota limit.

## Google Translation API ##

See [this repo](https://github.com/mouuff/Google-Translate-API) for
the original code.  Although this function works, Google has canceled
free translation api service.  So this file is provided for study use
only.  Use at your own risk.
